Overview
The Cancer Prediction System is an innovative application designed to assess individual cancer risk by leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. It analyzes comprehensive datasets, including genetic, medical, and lifestyle information, to identify individuals at high risk for developing cancer. By doing so, it facilitates early detection and timely intervention, significantly improving patient outcomes and contributing to the reduction of cancer incidence.

Problem Statement
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with millions of new cases diagnosed each year. Early detection is critical for successful treatment, but current methods often rely on reactive measures rather than proactive risk assessment. There is a need for a system that can accurately predict cancer risk, enabling early intervention and personalized preventive strategies to reduce the incidence and impact of cancer.

Solution
The Cancer Prediction System addresses this need by utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning to provide comprehensive risk assessments. The system integrates genetic data, medical records, and lifestyle factors to identify patterns and correlations that indicate cancer risk. By providing personalized risk scores and recommendations, it empowers individuals and healthcare providers to take proactive steps in cancer prevention and early detection.
